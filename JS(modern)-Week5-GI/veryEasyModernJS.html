        <p>What is the difference between the following JavaScript keywords: var,
           let and const.  Please provide a written explanation.<br> You are able to
           include a code reference along with your written explanation for each keyword.
        </p>

        <p>
            Var : The scoping of Var can be used globally and locally. If used locally it that variable 
            can not be used outside of that function it is in. <br>
            Var can cause bugs in code when used a lot globally or when there is another variable 
            with the same name but have a different meaning. 
        </p>
            <br><br>
        <p>
            Let : Let is an updated version of Var and is blocked scoped. 
            Variables in a block with the let is only available for use within that block.<br>
            Also variables cannot be declared more than once within a scope.
         </p>
            <br><br>
         <p>
             Const : Is also block scoped like Let. The major difference is that it can not be 
             mutated, changed, or updated.
